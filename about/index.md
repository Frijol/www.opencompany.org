The Open Company Initiative (OCI) is a group of companies committed to
maximizing trust through proactive openness as a defining value in our work.


### Our Vision

Trust is the foundation of the economy. The legal requirements establish a minimum requirement of trustworthiness, and the status quo for companies is to do as little as they can. How much more
productive would our economy be if instead we reached together for an upper
bound of trust? If the economy were based more on actual value, not the abstraction of money?

We envision a world in which companies and customers are trusted, because they have proven they are trustworthy. The winning companies of the future will be those that proactively maximize trust, going above and beyond the letter of the law to cultivate relationships of trust with customers, stakeholders, and society as a whole. We believe that this trust is a result of genuine transparency and openness.


### Our Pledge

### Programs and Operations

The OCI maintains a [directory of companies](/directory/) that have taken our
pledge.  However, the OCI is intentionally not a certifying body. Instead, we
invite our members to define for themselves how they will fulfill their pledge.
We invite innovation and the sharing of both successes and failures. We trust
the market and the court of public opinion to be our judge.

The OCI holds an [annual summit](/summit/), bringing together our members to
learn from one another and further our vision.

The OCI is housed at [The Saxifrage School](http://www.saxifrageschool.org/), a
higher education laboratory working to lower costs, foster transparency, re-think the campus, and
reconcile theory and practice. The Initiative is funded [on
Gittip](https://www.gittip.com/on/twitter/employeveryone/), and we communicate
primarily [using
GitHub](https://github.com/opencompany/opencompany.github.io/issues).
