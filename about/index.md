title: About the Initiative
---

The mission of the Open Company Initiative (OCI) is **to make corporate
trustworthiness normal**. Read [our vision](/vision/).

The OCI is specifically not a certifying body. Instead, we invite [our
members](/directory/) to define for themselves how they will proactively create
trust through genuine corporate transparency and openness. We invite
innovation, and the sharing of both successes and failures. We trust the market
and the court of public opinion to be the final judge of corporate
trustworthiness.

The OCI is housed at [The Saxifrage School](http://www.saxifrageschool.org/), a
higher education laboratory working to lower costs, re-think the campus and
reconcile theory and practice. In addition to maintaining this website, the OCI
holds an [annual summit](/summit/), apart from which we communicate primarily
[using GitHub](https://github.com/opencompany/opencompany.github.io/issues).
