title: Vision Statement
---

Trust is the foundation of the economy. The rule of law establishes a lower
bound of trustworthiness, and today's status quo is for companies to operate at
this lower bound, getting away with what they can. How much more productive
would the economy be if we sought instead for an upper bound of trust?

**We envision an economy in which corporations are trusted, because they are
trustworthy.** We believe that the winning companies of the future will be
those that earn the trust of society, not merely doing the minimum possible to
keep within the letter of the law, but going above and beyond to establish a
relationship of trust with their customers and with society as a whole.

We who belong to the Open Company Initiative pledge ourselves to finding
creative ways to earn your trust, not as an afterthought, but as a central
element in how we create value.
