title: Vision Statement
---

Trust is the foundation of the economy. The rule of law establishes a lower
bound of trustworthiness, and today's status quo is for corporations to operate
near this lower bound, getting away with what they can. How much more
productive would our economy be if instead we reached together for an upper
bound of trust?

**We envision a world in which corporations are trusted, because they are
trustworthy.** We believe that the winning companies of the future will be
those that create trust, not merely doing the minimum possible to keep within
the letter of the law, but going above and beyond to cultivate an ever-stronger
relationship of trust with their customers, their stakeholders, and society as
a whole. We believe that this trust will come primarily from genuine corporate
transparency and openness.

We who belong to the Open Company Initiative pledge to proactively create
trust, not as an afterthought, but as a defining element in how we create
value.
